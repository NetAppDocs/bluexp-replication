summary: NetApp SnapMirror replicates data at high speeds over LAN or WAN, so you get high data availability and fast data replication in both virtual and traditional environments. When you replicate data to NetApp storage systems and continually update the secondary data, your data is kept current and remains available whenever you need it. No external replication servers are required.

NetApp SnapMirror replicates data at high speeds over LAN or WAN, so you get high data availability and fast data replication in both virtual and traditional environments. When you replicate data to NetApp storage systems and continually update the secondary data, your data is kept current and remains available whenever you need it. No external replication servers are required.

== Features

* Replicate data between ONTAP storage systems to support backup and disaster recovery to the cloud or between clouds.

* Ensure the reliability of your DR environment with high availability.

* Efficient block-level replication between ONTAP storage is fast and efficient, with granular recovery points for both DR and backup.

== Cost

NetApp doesn't charge you for using the Replication service, but you'll need to check your cloud provider for applicable data ingress and egress charges.

== Supported working environments

Cloud Manager enables data replication between the following types of working environments.

== How data replication works

Cloud Manager simplifies data replication between volumes on separate ONTAP systems using SnapMirror and SnapVault technologies. You simply need to identify the source volume and the destination volume, and then choose a replication policy and schedule.

For Cloud Volumes ONTAP, Cloud Manager purchases the required disks, configures relationships, applies the replication policy, and then initiates the baseline transfer between volumes.

NOTE: The baseline transfer includes a full copy of the source data. Subsequent transfers contain differential copies of the source data.

== Supported data protection configurations

Cloud Manager supports simple, fanout, and cascade data protection configurations:

* In a simple configuration, replication occurs from volume A to volume B.

* In a fanout configuration, replication occurs from volume A to multiple destinations.

* In a cascade configuration, replication occurs from volume A to volume B and from volume B to volume C.
