[.lead]
You can replicate data between ONTAP working environments by choosing a one-time data replication for data transfer, or a recurring schedule for disaster recovery or long-term retention. For example, you can set up data replication from an on-prem ONTAP system to Cloud Volumes ONTAP for disaster recovery.

== Data replication requirements

Before you can replicate data, you should confirm that specific requirements are met for Cloud Volumes ONTAP, on-prem ONTAP clusters, or Amazon FSx for ONTAP.

Working environments::
If you haven't done so already, you need to create the working environments for the source and target in the data replication relationship.

* https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloud-manager-ontap-onprem/task-discovering-ontap.html[Discover ONTAP clusters^]

Version requirements::
You should verify that the source and destination volumes are running compatible ONTAP versions before replicating data.
+
https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/data-protection/compatible-ontap-versions-snapmirror-concept.html[View compatible ONTAP versions for SnapMirror relationships^]

Requirements specific to Cloud Volumes ONTAP::
* The instance's security group must include the required inbound and outbound rules: specifically, rules for ICMP and ports 11104 and 11105.
+
These rules are included in the predefined security group.

* To replicate data between two Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems in different subnets, the subnets must be routed together (this is the default setting).

* To replicate data between two Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems in different cloud providers, you must have a VPN connection between the virtual networks.

Requirements specific to ONTAP clusters::
* An active SnapMirror license must be installed.

* If the cluster is on your premises, you should have a connection from your corporate network to your virtual network in AWS, Azure, or GCP. This is typically a VPN connection.

* ONTAP clusters must meet additional subnet, port, firewall, and cluster requirements.
+
https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-sm-classic/peering/reference_prerequisites_for_cluster_peering.html[View prerequisites for cluster peering in the ONTAP documentation^]

Requirements specific to Amazon FSx for ONTAP::
* An Amazon FSx for ONTAP working environment must be the target in the data replication relationship.
+
The source can be Cloud Volumes ONTAP or an on-prem ONTAP cluster.

* If Cloud Volumes ONTAP is the source, ensure connectivity between VPCs by enabling VPC peering or by using a Transit Gateway.

* If an on-prem ONTAP cluster is the source, ensure connectivity between your on-premises network and the AWS VPC by using a Direct Connect or VPN connection.

== Replicate data between systems

You can replicate data by choosing a one-time data replication, which can help you move data to and from the cloud, or a recurring schedule, which can help with disaster recovery or long-term retention.

.Steps

. On the Canvas, select the working environment that contains the source volume, drag it to the working environment to which you want to replicate the volume, and then select *Replication*.
+
image:screenshot-drag-and-drop.png[Screen shot: Shows a working environment being placed on top of another working environment to start the data replication process.]
+
The remaining steps provide an example of how to create a sync relationship between Cloud Volumes ONTAP or on-prem ONTAP clusters.

. *Source and Destination Peering Setup*: If this page appears, select all of the intercluster LIFs for the cluster peer relationship.
+
The intercluster network should be configured so that cluster peers have _pair-wise full-mesh connectivity_, which means that each pair of clusters in a cluster peer relationship has connectivity among all of their intercluster LIFs.
+
These pages appear if an ONTAP cluster that has multiple LIFs is the source or destination.

. *Source Volume Selection*: Select the volume that you want to replicate.

. *Destination Disk Type and Tiering*: If the target is a Cloud Volumes ONTAP system, select the destination disk type and choose whether you want to enable data tiering.

. *Destination Volume Name*: Specify the destination volume name and choose the destination aggregate.
+
If the destination is an ONTAP cluster, you must also specify the destination storage VM.

. *Max Transfer Rate*: Specify the maximum rate (in megabytes per second) at which data can be transferred.
+
You should limit the transfer rate. An unlimited rate might negatively impact the performance of other applications and it might impact your internet performance.

. *Replication Policy*: Choose a default policy or click *Additional Policies*, and then select one of the advanced policies.
+
For help, link:concept-replication-policies.html[learn about replication policies].
+
If you choose a custom backup (SnapVault) policy, the labels associated with the policy must match the labels of the Snapshot copies on the source volume. For more information, link:concept-backup-policies.html[learn how backup policies work].

. *Schedule*: Choose a one-time copy or a recurring schedule.
+
Several default schedules are available. If you want a different schedule, you must create a new schedule on the _destination_ cluster using System Manager.

. *Review*: Review your selections and click *Go*.

.Result

Cloud Manager starts the data replication process. You can view details about the volume relationship in the Replication service.
